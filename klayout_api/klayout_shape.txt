class Shape(__Base)
 |  @brief An object representing a shape in the layout database
 |  
 |  The shape proxy is basically a pointer to a shape of different kinds.
 |  No copy of the shape is created: if the shape proxy is copied the copy still
 |  points to the original shape. If the original shape is modified or deleted,
 |  the shape proxy will also point to a modified or invalid shape.
 |  The proxy can be "null" which indicates an invalid reference.
 |  
 |  Shape objects are used together with the \Shapes container object which
 |  stores the actual shape objects and uses Shape references as pointers inside the
 |  actual data storage. Shape references are used in various places, i.e. when removing or
 |  transforming objects inside a \Shapes container.

 |      @brief Assigns another object to self
 |      @args other
 |  
 |  bbox(...)
 |      @brief Returns the bounding box of the shape
 |  
 |  create(...)
 |      @brief Ensures the C++ object is created
 |      Use this method to ensure the C++ object is created, for example to ensure that resources are allocated. Usually C++ objects are created on demand and not necessarily when the script object is created.
 |  
 |  darea(...)
 |      @brief Returns the area of the shape in square micrometer units
 |      This method has been added in version 0.25.
 |  
 |  dbbox(...)
 |      @brief Returns the bounding box of the shape in micrometer units

 |      This method has been introduced in version 0.23.
 |  
 |  delete_property(...)
 |      @brief Deletes the user property with the given key
 |      @args key
 |      This method is a convenience method that deletes the property with the given key. It does nothing if no property with that key exists. Using that method is more convenient than creating a new property set with a new ID and assigning that properties ID.
 |      This method may change the properties ID. Calling this method will invalidate any iterators. It should not be called inside a loop iterating over shapes.
 |      
 |      This method has been introduced in version 0.22.
 |  
 |  destroy(...)
 |      @brief Explicitly destroys the object

 |  destroyed(...)
 |      @brief Returns a value indicating whether the object was already destroyed
 |      This method returns true, if the object was destroyed, either explicitly or by the C++ side.
 |      The latter may happen, if the object is owned by a C++ object which got destroyed itself.

 |  each_dpoint(...)
 |      @brief Iterates over all points of the object and returns points in micrometer units
 |      
 |      This method iterates over all points of the object like \each_point, but it returns \DPoint objects that are given in micrometer units already. Multiplication with the database unit happens internally.

 |      
 |      This method has been introduced in version 0.25.
 |  
 |  each_edge(...)
 |      @brief Iterates over the edges of a single contour of the object
 |      @param contour The contour number (0 for hull, 1 for first hole ...)
 |      
 |      This method applies to polygons and simple polygons and delivers all edges that form the given contour of the polygon. The hull has contour number 0, the first hole has contour 1 etc.
 |      Hole edges are oriented counterclockwise while hull egdes are oriented clockwise.
 |      
 |      It will throw an exception if the object is not a polygon.
 |      
 |      This method was introduced in version 0.24.
 |  
 |  each_point(...)
 |      @brief Iterates over all points of the object
 |

 |  
 |  is_simple_polygon(...)
 |      @brief Returns true, if the shape is a simple polygon
 |      
 |      This method returns true only if the object is a simple polygon. The simple polygon identity is contained in the polygon identity, so usually it is sufficient to use \is_polygon? and \polygon instead of specifically handle simply polygons. This method is provided only for specific optimisation purposes.

 |      This method has been introduced in version 0.22.
 |  
 |  set_property(...)
 |      @brief Sets the user property with the given key to the given value
 |      @args key, value
 |      This method is a convenience method that sets the property with the given key to the given value. If no property with that key exists, it will create one. Using that method is more convenient than creating a new property set with a new ID and assigning that properties ID.
 |      This method may change the properties ID. Calling this method will invalidate any iterators. It should not be called inside a loop iterating over shapes.
 |      
 |      This method has been introduced in version 0.22.
 |
